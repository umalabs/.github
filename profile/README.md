With the rapid adoption of APIs by companies across all industries, security ranks as the top challenge for most developers. When it comes to API protection, developers have the option to use API keys or tokens. Although both options are valid API protection techniques, tokens are a more robust choice. An API key does not carry any information about the user and never expires unless revoked by the API provider. On the other hand, tokens have a limited lifetime and can convey information about the application and the user to the API provider.

UMA Labs focuses on the innovative use of authentication and authorization technologies in open networks in conformance with the [NIST Special Publication 800-63C](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63c.html), Digital Identity Guidelines: Federation and Assertions. We introduce a new API security architecture through the [Identity Propagation and Assertions](https://github.com/umalabs/identity-propagation-and-assertions) concept. This architecture is beneficial for cross-domain web API protection systems.

As a proof of concept, we developed [Federizer](https://github.com/umalabs/federizer), a message transfer agent (MTA) that transfers arbitrary messages from one computer to another using the gRPC framework. The MTA uses a client authentication mechanism — mTLS certificate-bound access tokens issued by the Security Token Service (STS) — to convey the user's security context alongside messages across security boundaries.
