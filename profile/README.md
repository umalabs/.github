With the rapid web API adoption by companies across all industries, security ranks as the top challenge for most developers. When it comes to API protection, developers have the option to use API keys or tokens. Although both options are valid API protection techniques, tokens are a more robust choice. An API key does not carry any information about the user and never expires unless revoked by the API provider. On the other hand, tokens have a limited lifetime and can convey to the API provider information about the application that may act on behalf of the user.

UMA Labs focuses on the innovative use of authentication and authorization technologies in open networks in conformance with the [NIST Special Publication 800-63C](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63c.html), Digital Identity Guidelines: Federation and Assertions. We introduce a new proxied architecture through the [Identity Propagation and Assertions](https://github.com/umalabs/identity-propagation-and-assertions) concept. This architecture is beneficial for cross-domain web API protection systems.

As a proof of concept, we developed [Propagator](https://github.com/umalabs/propagator) â€” a data transfer system with a generic web API that can send and receive virtually any type of document, file, or collection of bytes across security boundaries.
