UMA Labs focuses on the innovative use of authentication and authorization technologies in open networks in conformance with the [NIST Special Publication 800-63C](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63c.html), Digital Identity Guidelines: Federation and Assertions. We introduce a new kind of brokered architecture through the [Identity Propagator](https://github.com/umalabs/identity-propagator) project that cannot impersonate any RP to an IdP, and any IdP to an RP.
