UMA Labs focuses on the innovative use of authorization technologies. We explore the User-Managed Access and OAuth2 frameworks. We solved multiple problems:

* The ability to dynamically build trust between mutually unknown parties.
* How to convey information about the user from an identity provider to an authorization server across security domain boundaries.
* Fine-grained access control.

Given these points, our efforts resulted in designing a Correlated Authorization trust framework. This framework allows organizations to trust external identities and data.
