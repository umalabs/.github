UMA Labs focuses on the innovative use of authentication and authorization technologies in open networks in conformance with the [NIST Special Publication 800-63C](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63c.html), Digital Identity Guidelines: Federation and Assertions. We introduce a new API security architecture through the [Identity Propagation and Assertions](https://github.com/umalabs/identity-propagation-and-assertions) concept. This architecture is beneficial for protecting MTA-to-MTA communication.

As a proof of concept, we developed [Federizer](https://github.com/umalabs/federizer), a message transfer agent (MTA) that transfers arbitrary messages from one computer to another using the gRPC framework. The MTA uses a client authentication mechanism — [mTLS certificate-bound access tokens issued by the Security Token Service (STS)](https://github.com/umalabs/identity-propagation-and-assertions) — to convey the user's security context alongside messages across security boundaries.
